# TrackFPV
Use your Fatshark or Skyzone goggles as a virtual reality headset.

Fast overview:
Use an Arduino Micro as a Joystick for OpenTrack with the input of your FPV-Headtracker.

Hardware:
- Arduino Micro (ATmega32U4 = featuring a built-in USB which makes the Micro recognisable as a joystick)
- 3,5 mm phone jack from your goggle
- Mirroring the Computer-Screen to the goggle with a HDMI to AV converter

Software: 
- install the latest OpenTrack software https://github.com/opentrack/opentrack/releases
- install latest Arduino IDE and drivers

Libraries used in this project:
- Joystick.h https://github.com/MHeironimus/ArduinoJoystickLibrary
- CPPM.h https://github.com/jmparatte/CPPM

Installation:
1. prepare Hardware. Ground to Ground and the PPM-Pin to D4 (itÂ´s the ICP-Pin)
2. install the libraries
3. upload the sketch to the Arduino
4. check if the Arduino is detected from the copmuter (Windows Control Panel >> Hardware >> Devices >> Arduino Micro
5. start OpenTrack and import the "TrackFPV.ini" profile
